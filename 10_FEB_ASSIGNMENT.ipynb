    "ANS = In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. It allows you to interact with files in various modes. The general syntax of the open() function is as follows:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* 'r' (Read Mode):\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the default mode.\n",
    "It allows you to read data from the file.\n",
    "The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",

    "If the file already exists, its content is truncated (deleted).\n",
    "If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",

    "This mode is used to append data to an existing file.\n",

    "If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "The file pointer is placed at the end of the file.\n",

    "* 'b' (Binary Mode):\n",
    "\n",
    "This mode is used to open a file in binary mode, allowing you to read and write binary data.\n",

    "\n",
    "* '+' (Update Mode):\n",
    "\n",
    "This mode allows you to read and write to a file simultaneously.\n",
    "For example, 'r+' allows both reading and writing, and 'w+' allows reading and writing, with the file being truncated.\n",
    "To use a combination of modes, you can concatenate them. For example:\n",
    "\n",

    "'a+': Append in text mode and allow reading.\n",

    "ANS = The close() function is used to close an open file in Python. It is essential to close a file after performing operations on it to release the system resources associated with the file. When you open a file, the operating system allocates certain resources to handle the file operations. These resources include file buffers, file pointers, and other internal data structures. If you don't close the file properly, these resources might not be released until the Python program terminates, which can lead to several issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Leakage: If you open a large number of files without closing them, it can lead to resource leakage, as the resources associated with each open file are not released until the program terminates. This can cause your program to consume more memory and other system resources than necessary, potentially leading to performance problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integrity: When you write data to a file, the data may not be immediately flushed to the disk. Instead, it is often buffered in memory to improve I/O performance. If you don't close the file properly, the data might not be written to the disk, and you could lose important data in case of a program crash or unexpected termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "File Locking: Some operating systems implement file locking mechanisms to prevent multiple processes from simultaneously modifying the same file. If you don't close the file properly, it might remain locked, preventing other processes from accessing or modifying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these issues, it is important to close the file using the close() method when you have finished performing operations on it. Here's an example of how to properly close a file using the close() method:\n",
